  <h3>Some problems that came up</h3>
  <p>In order to get the data on the map, you had to use fips codes that had to be merged with the data.</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>
      There was more fips than zip codes because one zip reagion is formed many fips.
    </li>
    <li>
      When mergin fips codes to the data frame it was creating extra rows because every unique zip have so many rows as many fips it have. 
    </li>
    <li>
      There was also GeoJSON data that uses a zip instead a fips but it wasn't contain ID what plotly's map need.
    </li>
    <li>
      I couldn't also find a way how to make animation cumulative in a way that system size cumulates correctly binded whit fips and years. 
    </li>
  </ul>
